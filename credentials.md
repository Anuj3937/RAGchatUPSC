# Default User Credentials

This file documents the default passwords for newly created users. Since the admin creates all user accounts, these initial passwords should be communicated to the users so they can log in for the first time. It is highly recommended that all users change their password upon their first login.

## Roles and Passwords

-   **Admin:** The initial admin account should be created directly in the Firebase Authentication console.

-   **Teacher:**
    -   Default Password: `teacher123`

-   **Student:**
    -   Default Password: `student123`

## Security Note

These are default, insecure passwords intended only for initial setup. In a production environment, you should implement a more secure mechanism, such as:
-   Forcing a password reset on first login.
-   Sending one-time login links via email.
